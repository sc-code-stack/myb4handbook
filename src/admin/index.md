# Admins & Configuration

This chapter will explain the various functions of the 'tenant admin' role, including the various [**'User Roles'**](./roles.md), how to [**'Create new users'**](./create-users.md), adding and managing [**'Security Tags'**](./security.md), and how to [**'Calibrate a Tenant'**](./callibration.md). This chapter is primarily aimed at admin users, but even regular users may find [**Chapter 4.4: Tenant Calibration**](./callibration.md) useful as a means to understand how various presets may alter the algorithm operation.
