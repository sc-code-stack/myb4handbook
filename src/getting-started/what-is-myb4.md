# What is myB4<sup>TM</sup>?

**myB4<sup>TM</sup>** is a family of tools and methodologies designed to help organisations identify, quantify and prevent fraud and financial damage, and to train and strengthen the organisation's defences against the 'commercial dark arts'. They have been developed based on over 100,000 hours of combined experience with fraud detection, prevention, data science, and restorative justice.

**myB4.ai** sits at the core of myB4<sup>TM</sup>. It is a secure cloud-based SaaS-platform, which allows your organisation to undertake a deep scan of their transactional records, to find those counterparties which may be commercially damaging. 
This may be anything from trusted suppliers doing underhanded things, customers taking advantage, or internal/external parties seeking to exploit weak control systems. 

**The myB4<sup>TM</sup> Radar** gives you an instant impression of which counterparties present a risk, based on our proprietary algorithms. It gives a risk ranking based on a multitude of transactional flags and patterns. You can read more in [Chapter 3.5 'The myB4 Radar'](../user-guide/radar.md).

```admonish info "What is myB4.ai NOT?"
myB4.ai is NOT a replacement for real humans. At the core of our methodology is the notion that every employee is a fraud detective. myB4.ai is a tool to support these processes, not override them. It allows compliance/audit teams to streamline their investigations, and analyse large amounts of data, without missing important signals, or spending time chasing noise.
