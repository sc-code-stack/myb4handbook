# The myB4.ai Handbook

Welcome to the instruction handbook and knowledge base for **myB4<sup>TM</sup>**.
Here you will find guidance on getting started, navigating the platform, uploading and reading data, as well as utilising the admin features. Additionally, we will update this handbook with useful tootips and new features. 
Use the sidebar on the left to navigate, or the search bar in the top left corner.

If you are new, start by reading the [**Getting Started**](./getting-started/index.md) section.

If you cannot find what you are looking for, or if something is unclear, reach out to the contact(s) listed under [**Help & Troubleshooting**](./help/index.md)

## Technical Terms

Throughout this manual, you may come across terminology you are unsure about. We have tried to include as many of these in the end [**Glossary**](./glossary.md), and if you hover over the words, you will get a definition. Try it now: **myB4.ai** 

We try to keep the list of terms as comprehensive as possible, but if you ever encounter a term you do not understand, please reach out to the B4 Team, and we will both clarify to you, and add it to our glossary.
