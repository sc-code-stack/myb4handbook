# User Guide

Using a tool like myB4.ai may be a daunting task. It consists of multiple components, and it might be a challenge to intuit how they work and fit together. Additionally, while the foundation is transactional records, which should be familiar to most users, the resulting analysis contains flags and terms which may be less familiar. 

This chapter is an attempt to demystify myB4.ai. It is structured in a natural order to first give you a general overview of the dashboard, then cover scope creation and data requirements, followed by the data upload and analysis process. The latter half then covers the resulting analysis tools, introducing the workings of the Radar, Insights, and covering a typical workflow and how to read and interpret the analysis.
